# Vibe Coding with C# 13 in Enterprise Environments (csharp13-vibe-coding-enterprise)

## Overview
Learn how clean code, clean architecture, and modern C# 13 features transform enterprise systems with Ziggy Rafiq's article "Vibe Coding with C# 13 in Enterprise Environments
Enterprise software development often struggles with complexity, rigid architectures, and developer burnout.  
This repo demonstrates how to apply **Vibe Coding** ‚Äî the flow-based approach that combines:

- **C# 13 modern features** (primary constructors, collection literals, interceptors, etc.)  
- **Clean Architecture** for maintainability and scalability  
- **DDD patterns** (Entities, Value Objects, Repositories, Aggregates)  
- **Best practices & industry standards** (SOLID, CQRS, automated testing)
